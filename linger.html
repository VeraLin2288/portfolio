            <h2 class="brown-text">Depressed Lingering Traveler</h2>
            <p>We are all lingering travelers. Grow up, leave hometown, move on and integrate into the new environment.
                It is a circle that no one is able to escape. Humans are gregarious animals, eager for a sense of
                belonging and security in groups. I am an international student and it has been two years I could not go
                back to distant hometown. In the mood of homesickness, the short days and foul weather conspire to drive
                me into the ground. </p>
            <br>
            <p>However, it is a common phenomenon to suffer from seasonal depression in such an environment. It often
                makes me feel empty and sad, lack of energy and oversleeping. So for the first thematic work, I decided
                to take photography on surrounding things from the perspective of people with seasonal depression
                patients represented by me. The purpose of this project is to explore the feeling and emotion of
                seasonal depression. And it also means to study how the environment triggers seasonal depression. To a
                certain extent, the color of photo is connected with emotion. The cold-tone photos express my
                depression, homesickness and loneliness to viewers in the most direct way. When choosing the shooting
                location and subject, I chose the scene of snow and sunset which are most easy to trigger people's
                sadness and depression. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I hope when the warm spring comes, seasonal depression will leave me. But these photos record my emotion
                and feeling when I was a lingering traveller in a foreign country. After few years I will leave here,
                move on and the photos recall the memory when I look back. </p>
